You don't need to write all of them, just make sure you have 8 points in total across all of the thinkers

Ethical Question: Should a high school student cheat on an important exam to avoid failing?

Aristotle:
- Aristotle would argue that cheating violates the virtue of honesty, which is key to living a flourishing life.
- He would emphasize that true success comes from developing one's abilities through hard work, not shortcuts.
- He would also say that a person must cultivate self-control and temperance, meaning they should resist the temptation to cheat.
- Aristotle would view cheating as a failure to fulfill one's potential and to live according to reason.

Kant:
- Kant would say that cheating is morally wrong because it cannot be universalized—if everyone cheated, the concept of exams would become meaningless.
- He would stress that a person has a duty to act with integrity and respect the rules, regardless of the consequences.
- Kant would argue that cheating treats others as a means to an end, rather than as ends in themselves, which violates his categorical imperative.
- He would believe that the moral law requires individuals to act ethically even when faced with challenging situations or personal consequences.

Levinas:
- Levinas would argue that cheating is unethical because it betrays the trust between the student and the teacher, which is fundamental to human relationships.
- He would emphasize the student's responsibility to others, highlighting that their actions affect the community and the Other.
- Levinas would view cheating as a failure to honor the dignity of others, especially the teacher and fellow students.
- He would argue that the ethical self is bound by an obligation to the Other, meaning that cheating is a violation of moral responsibility.

- The capacity to act independently and make decisions.  
- The power to shape one's own life and influence the world around them.  
- The ability to exercise control over one's actions and outcomes.  
- The freedom to choose between alternatives and affect change.  
- The autonomy to act according to personal values, beliefs, and desires.  
- The capacity to respond to challenges and make decisions in various situations.  
- The power to influence one's environment and social context.

### pg. 16


Action: Rescuing an infant from a fire.
Who: The neighbour.
Where: From the second storey of a building

This action helps us understand human agency by showing how individuals can make quick, purposeful decisions in urgent situations. It also highlights how external factors, like the fire, influence people to act autonomously and with a clear goal in mind. Evaluating the action reveals the neighbour's sense of responsibility and ethical values driving their decision to rescue the infant

### pg. 17

Question 2:
How did the neighbour manage to reach the infant safely?
Was anyone else involved in the rescue or did the neighbour act alone

Question 3:

Rescuing the infant is a human action because it involves conscious decision-making, a clear goal, and moral reasoning, all of which are guided by human values.
Unlike animal actions, human actions are deliberate and driven by complex thought, rather than instinct, allowing for intentional, goal-oriented behavior in response to a specific situation
