# 406. Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (Part 1)

## 01. Theorem

If $f(x)$ is continuous on the closed interval $[a, b]$ and $F(x)$ is the anti derivative of $f(x)$, then

$$
\int_a^bf(x)dx = F(b)-F(a)
$$

This theorem is the same principles used in [[402-integration-by-substitution|402. Integration by Substitution]].
